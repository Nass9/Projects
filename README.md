      Project on Python/R : SEEKING SIGNALS FROM ESG DATA 

      Purpose :  Show that applying Machine Learning methods on ESG dataset allows us to create
      equity portfolio with higher return and lower volatility than their benchmark. We also investigate the
      interpretability of our models using SHapley Additive exPlanations and compare the results to a traditional
      Logistic Regression-based approach. We next used the Fama/French Five-Factor for a Backtesting of our result.

Financial Econometrics:

    Projet on Python :
    Unobserved Components Models in Economics and Finance : The role of the Kalman filter in time series econometrics

    Purpose: The treatment of time series using state space models (SSM), the fundamental objective of this project 
    is to show that systems can be explained by a set of unobservable components (trend, seasonality, cycle, error in particular).
    Major role of the Kalman filter algorithm in the resolution of SSM models and good flexibility of the algorithm according 
    to the characteristics of the system.

    Some Models:

    UNIVARIATE LINEAR MODELS:
      Local level model
      Linear trend model
      Linear trend model with seasonality

    MULTIVARIATE LINEAR MODELS:
      Linear trend cycle decomposition model
      Variable frequency model: Kalman filter offers the flexibility needed for dealing with data irregularities, 
                                such as missing observations and observations at mixed frequencies.



Machine Learning :

    Project on python : Predict age from brain gray matter

    Modelling Methodology :
    Two step prediction:
    - We used a Kmeans algorithm to binarize our target variable. This cutoff is determined relatively 
    arbitrarily from the results of the interpreted Kmeans.
    We then used the Recursive Feature Elimination Cross-Validation (RFECV) variable selection algorithm, and implemented 
    this algorithm on Random Forest with Accuracy as a performance metric in order to have a balanced distribution of the target. 
    We optimized our models with GridsearchCV.

    -Next, we decided here to apply a Ridge model to each of the two sub-dataframes using the same methodology: 
    Variable selection by RFECV
    Determination of the optimal penalization ("Alpha") of the model thanks to RidgeCV on each of the two sub-models.
    Results obtained by Cross-Validation

Advanced python :

    Project on Python/PySpark : 

    Resume: For this project we have chosen to work on two IMDb databases found on Kaggle. In this 
    project we will process these databases on PySpark in order to develop an analysis on these data.

    Database processing on PySpark:
    Quasi-Json decoding 
    Data preprocessing (missing values...)

    Statistical analysis:
    Descriptive statistics
    Data visualization
    
    
    Natural Language Processing :

      Hard cleaning, with two funtions made to remove :
      - Punctuation, accents and capitalization
      - Words of less than 2 letters and more than 18 letters
      - Single numbers and numbers embedded in words

      Treat stopwords:
        Tokenization  
        Lemmatization
        Word Embedding ( Modèle FastText de Facebook, Kmeans)

      Text Data Visualization
      Topic Modelling : Optimal topics
      LDA(linear discriminant analysis) for Topic Modelling

    To put our analysis further we have created a movie recommendation system based on the LDA results.
